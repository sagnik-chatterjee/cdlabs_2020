BUGS :
1. in q2.c while printing the revrse , the first character from the end is showing 
some garbage value 
and also there is some space left in printing (but that may be due to the buffer size that i taking
of 1024 char long )

2. (Dont know)in q1 the no of characters are printed perfectly but the number 
of lines are not being printed , being printed only 0

3. There exists lot of space between the characters and not all characters are beign read properly.
